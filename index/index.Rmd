Find below the most up-to-date materials created for the UIC Biological Sciences Department online teaching efforts. If you need more assistance, consider joining the BIOS Teaching Slack workspace (see section on [Slack](http://ledelaney.org/cb-materials/index.html#slack) below for more details), or email me at `ldelan5 at uic dot edu`. My **official working hours are Mon-Fri from 1p-5p**, but I am usually very responsive via email or Slack. 

_Note: Help me help you by adding me to your Bb course(s) as a TA or Instructor!

## How can I help?

+ Assist with building your course: copying content between courses, creating a course structure, building content areas to populate, organizing your Welcome page, and more!
+ Assist with technical questions relating to Bb, Collaborate, Panopto, Zoom, etc.
+ Assist with \& discuss best practices for online teaching tools like Bb, Collaborate, Panopto, Zoom, etc.
+ Assist with Bb test creation and test settings to ensure exams go smoothly.
+ Discuss test strategies and possibilities available within Bb.
+ Discuss best practices for assessment deployment and grading (e.g., increase transparency for students and make things easier for TAs).
+ Assist in creating Grade Center columns that can accurately calculate final letter grades specific to your course and increase transparency for students.
+ Troubleshoot student Bb issues (e.g., What's the deal with `My Grades`??, or, Why can't I see what my students can see??).
+ Assist with various Panopto challenges.
+ Other stuff unique to your needs -- feel free to reach out!

While I do have some overlap with LTS, they are still your best bet for bona-fide technical glitches as they have more access to "back door" operations than I do. However, I tend to respond more quickly, and I'm always happy to help figure out whether or not the issue requires their support or is something we can fix ourselves.

## Drop-in Hours

I hold twice-weekly drop-in hours open to anyone teaching online this semester. No question is too big or too small and I especially encourage TAs to come by if experiencing Bb fatigue and/or confusion. 

_Note: You must use your UIC Zoom account to join these sessions._
